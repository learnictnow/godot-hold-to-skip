# godot-hold-to-skip
A working example of holding down a button for a set time to skip to the next scene.

This project has four scenes that contain a progress bar that increments when the space bar is held. When the set time (stored in a variable) has expired the scene changes to one that is specified.

When the spacebar is released the counter resets to 0.

You can also set which scene will be loaded through the use of an exported variable.
